# User Defined Function
A user-defined function (UDF) in SQL Server is a function created by the user that can be used to encapsulate logic for reusability and better organization of code. UDFs can return a single value (scalar functions) or a table (table-valued functions).

# What are scalar functions
SQL Server scalar function takes one or more parameters and returns a single value.

The scalar functions help you simplify your code. For example, you may have a complex calculation that appears in many queries. Instead of including the formula in every query, you can create a scalar function that encapsulates the formula and uses it in each query.
