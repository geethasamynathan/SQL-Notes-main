In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), VARCHAR and NVARCHAR are both used to store variable-length character data, but they have some key differences:

# VARCHAR
**Stands for:** Variable Character.

**Storage:** Uses 1 byte per character.

**Character Set:** Non-Unicode. Suitable for storing ASCII characters.

**Max Length:** Up to 8,000 characters (or VARCHAR(MAX) for up to 2 GB).

**Use Case:** Ideal for storing English text or other languages that do not require Unicode support.

# NVARCHAR
**Stands for:** National Variable Character.

**Storage:** Uses 2 bytes per character.

**Character Set:** Unicode. Can store any character defined by the Unicode Standard, which includes characters from multiple languages.

**Max Length:** Up to 4,000 characters (or NVARCHAR(MAX) for up to 2 GB).

**Use Case:** Necessary for storing multilingual data or any text that includes special characters from various languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean, Arabic).
# When to Choose Which
**Use VARCHAR** when you are certain that the data will only contain characters from a single language or character set that does not require Unicode. This can save storage space and improve performance.

**Use NVARCHAR** when you need to store text in multiple languages or when you need to support special characters. This ensures that your data can accommodate any character from the Unicode standard.
# Example
Here’s a simple example to illustrate the difference:
```sql
SQL

-- Using VARCHAR
CREATE TABLE ExampleVarchar (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Using NVARCHAR
CREATE TABLE ExampleNvarchar (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    description NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Inserting data
INSERT INTO ExampleVarchar (id, description) VALUES (1, 'Hello');
INSERT INTO ExampleNvarchar (id, description) VALUES (1, N'こんにちは'); -- Japanese for "Hello"
```
